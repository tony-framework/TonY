TonY is a framework to _natively_ run deep learning jobs on [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/).
It currently supports [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) and [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod).
TonY enables running either single node or distributed
training as a Hadoop application. This native connector, together with other TonY features, aims to run
machine learning jobs reliably and flexibly. For a quick overview of TonY and comparisons to other frameworks, please see
[this presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/ssuser72f42a/scaling-deep-learning-on-hadoop-at-linkedin).

## Compatibility Notes

TonY itself is compatible with [Hadoop 2.6.0](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.6.0/) (CDH5.11.0) and above. If you need GPU isolation from TonY, you need [Hadoop 2.10](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.10.0/) or higher for Hadoop 2, or [Hadoop 3.1.0](https://hortonworks.com/blog/gpus-support-in-apache-hadoop-3-1-yarn-hdp-3/) or higher for Hadoop 3.

## Build

TonY is built using [Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle). To build TonY, run:

    ./gradlew build

This will automatically run tests, if want to build without running tests, run:

    ./gradlew build -x test

The jar required to run TonY will be located in `./tony-cli/build/libs/`.

## Usage

There are two ways to launch your deep learning jobs with TonY:
- Use a zipped Python virtual environment.
- Use Docker container.

### Use a zipped Python virtual environment

The difference between this approach and the one with Docker is
- You don't need to set up your Hadoop cluster with Docker support.
- There is no requirement on a Docker image registry.

As you know, nothing comes for free. If you don't want to bother setting your cluster with Docker support, you'd need to prepare a zipped virtual environment for your job and your cluster should have the same OS version as the computer which builds the Python virtual environment.

#### Python virtual environment in a zip

    $ unzip -Z1 my-venv.zip | head -n 10
      Python/
      Python/bin/
      Python/bin/rst2xml.py
      Python/bin/wheel
      Python/bin/rst2html5.py
      Python/bin/rst2odt.py
      Python/bin/rst2s5.py
      Python/bin/pip2.7
      Python/bin/saved_model_cli
      Python/bin/rst2pseudoxml.pyc

#### TonY jar and tony.xml

    MyJob/
      > src/
        > models/
          mnist_distributed.py
      tony.xml
      tony-cli-0.4.7-all.jar
      my-venv.zip # The additional file you need.

A similar `tony.xml` but without Docker related configurations:

    $ cat tony/tony.xml
    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>tony.worker.instances</name>
        <value>4</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>tony.worker.memory</name>
        <value>4g</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>tony.worker.gpus</name>
        <value>1</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>tony.ps.memory</name>
        <value>3g</value>
      </property>
    </configuration>

Then you can launch your job:

    $ java -cp "`hadoop classpath --glob`:MyJob/*:MyJob" \
                com.linkedin.tony.cli.ClusterSubmitter \
                -executes models/mnist_distributed.py \ # relative path to model program inside the src_dir
                -task_params '--input_dir /path/to/hdfs/input --output_dir /path/to/hdfs/output \
                -python_venv my-venv.zip \
                -python_binary_path Python/bin/python \  # relative path to the Python binary inside the my-venv.zip
                -src_dir src

### Use a Docker container
Note that this requires you have a properly configured Hadoop cluster with Docker support. Check this [documentation](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.9.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/DockerContainers.html) if you are unsure how to set it up. Assuming you have properly set up your Hadoop cluster with Docker container runtime, you should have already built a proper Docker image with required Hadoop configurations. The next thing you need is to install your Python dependencies inside your Docker image - TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Below is a folder structure of what you need to launch the job:

    MyJob/
      > src/
        > models/
          mnist_distributed.py
      tony.xml
      tony-cli-0.4.7-all.jar

The `src/` folder would contain all your training script. The `tony.xml` is used to config your training job. Specifically for using Docker as the container runtime, your configuration should be similar to something below:

    $ cat MyJob/tony.xml
    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>tony.worker.instances</name>
        <value>4</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>tony.worker.memory</name>
        <value>4g</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>tony.worker.gpus</name>
        <value>1</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>tony.ps.memory</name>
        <value>3g</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>tony.docker.enabled</name>
        <value>true</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>tony.docker.containers.image</name>
        <value>YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME</value>
      </property>
    </configuration>

For a full list of configurations, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/linkedin/TonY/wiki/TonY-Configurations).

Now you're ready to launch your job:

    $ java -cp "`hadoop classpath --glob`:MyJob/*:MyJob/" \
            com.linkedin.tony.cli.ClusterSubmitter \
            -executes models/mnist_distributed.py \
            -task_params '--input_dir /path/to/hdfs/input --output_dir /path/to/hdfs/output' \
            -src_dir src \
            -python_binary_path /home/user_name/python_virtual_env/bin/python

| conf               | no        | --conf tony.application.security.enabled=false    | Override configurations from your configuration file via command line

## TonY configurations

There are multiple ways to specify configurations for your TonY job. As above, you can create an XML file called `tony.xml`
and add its parent directory to your java classpath.

Alternatively, you can pass `-conf_file <name_of_conf_file>` to the java command line if you have a file not named `tony.xml`
containing your configurations. (As before, the parent directory of this file must be added to the java classpath.)

If you wish to override configurations from your configuration file via command line, you can do so by passing `-conf <tony.conf.key>=<tony.conf.value>` argument pairs on the command line.

Please check our [wiki](https://github.com/linkedin/TonY/wiki/TonY-Configurations) for all TonY configurations and their default values.

    ```
    Why?

    Try adding the path to your libjvm.so shared library to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable for your workers. See above for an example.

2. How do I configure arbitrary TensorFlow job types?
